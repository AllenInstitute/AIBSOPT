Build notes for laser illumination on AIBS OPT.

Goal is to have a high-powered light source with narrow line widths for improved imaging performance over LED illumination.  Laser line widths make it easier to find appropriate optical filters for multi-colored imaging.  

For laser launch, requirement is for lasers in desired wavelengths combined into single multi-mode fiber with despeckler.  Implementation here is a simplified NicoLase 1200 design supporting two diode lasers (488 nm and 552 nm nominal wavelengths) with EvenField despeckler into Thorlabs square-core multimode fiber. Fiber choice is dictated by NA. The square-core Thorlabs fiber has an NA of 0.39; Thorlabs also sells a number of typical round-core fibers with same or higher NA for ~$50 less. Any should work but only the square-core fiber we had on hand was tested.   

Small footprint of the laser launch allows it to fit onto a 12" x 12" breadboard for easy deployment. Two lines is sufficient for desired experiments. Enclosure holds laser launch in compact box that is easy to fit on a shelf.  Drill some holes into top panel and you can use screws or zip ties to mount laser control remotes and motor driver board on exterior.  

Illuminator takes fiber output and generates homogeneous hexagon of light at the specimen plane. Using a fiber of lower NA could result in less even illumination out of the hexagonal light pipe. In that case a longer light pipe (eg the Edmund 50 mm 49-402 vs Edmund 25 mm 63-082 quoted here) may be adventageous. The illuminator assembly fits into lens tubes of similar dimension to Thorlabs LED, so swapping out illumination choices is straightforward.

Illuminator uses a single lens to project front hexagonal face of light pipe onto specimen. This means focusing and magnfication are coupled. For the #63-082 pipe, the front face is 4.0 mm across the flats.  The illuminator should sit near the OPT collection lens, but behind the front element of that component.  This is a minimum distance of ~170 mm from the specimen.  With a f = 35 mm lens, this would mean placing the lens (1 / 35 mm) = (1 / 170 mm) - (1 / x) ; x = 44 mm away from the light pipe output.  This yields a M = 170 / 44 = 3.8x magnification, for a spot 15.2 mm across the hexagonal flats.  If the distance was 190 mm, the spot would be 17.6 mm.  In most cases a smaller spot size is preferred to preserve illumination intensity over the specimen, so a shorter distance (or longer focal length lens) is preferred.
 
TTL outputs from laser head or remote can go directly into OPT Motor Board.  Home-made SMB pigtails were used on our implementation.  

Cost is mostly price of laser diodes ($~15k for models used here), with another $~3k in optics, filters, and machined parts to complete build.
