Scanner=SkyScan3000
; A string with at least 11 characters. Typically, the first 7 characters refer to the company, and the last 4 characters are 4-digits ---
; scanner model (in case of non-digits, it is interpreted as 0) . Model number 0-2999: X-ray systems;
; Model 3000-3999: Optical scanner systems
; Please respect the number of letters: hardcoded inside NRecon.
Instrument S/N=2
; info only: serial number of the scanner
[Acquisition]
Optical Axis (line)= 1011
; Important parameter: the central slice in which the x-ray hits the detector perpendicularly;
Object to Source (mm)=100000
; Important parameter: distance between image center and the x-ray source. If the distance is > 10m, it is assumed that it is a
; parallel beam scan.
Number Of Files= 400
; Info only. Number of projections, dimension and pixel . information are actually obtained/confirmed from the TIFF files
Number Of Rows= 2054
; info only
Number Of Columns= 2456 
NRecon User Manual 512
; info only
Image Pixel Size (um)=7.9
; info only. The pixel size is actually read from the header of the 16-bit TIFF files.
; Important! For cone-beam geometry: the concept of "virtual detector" is exploit. More specifically, the detector is
; assumed to be centered at the FOV.
; Therefore, the pixel size in the TIFF header should have been scaled accordingly.
; Alternatively, one may use the non-standard key Scaled Image Pixel Size (um) to indicate pixel size scaled at image center.
Linear pixel value=0
; Non-standard key. Default: 0, exponential attenuation case; 1: Linear case ; -1: inverse linear
Scaled Image Pixel Size (um)=13.8
; Non-standard key. When present, it has higher priority than pixel information in TIF header
Exposure (ms)=5
; info only
Rotation Step (deg)=0.900
; Important parameter
Table Feed (micron)=0.0
; Spiral CT specific: table movement length per rotation step
; Positive: table movement direction coincides with projection vertical direction
Use 360 Rotation=YES
; Important parameter: YES or NO (360 or 180+)
Flat Field Correction=ON
; info only
Rotation Direction=CC
; Important parameter: TRY IT OUT TO SEE IF IT SHOULD BE cc OR cw. Almost all SkyScan scanners have rotation direction CC.
Type of Detector Motion=STEP AND SHOOT
; info only
Scanning Trajectory=ROUND
; info only. Spiral scan is recognized by entry “table feed”
