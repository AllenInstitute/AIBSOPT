Specimen chamber for demo system built from 3 1/4" x 4" x 1.2 mm glass slides (Brain Research Laboratories part 3140).  These were cut to size w/ glass cutter and glued together with Dow Corning #732 clear silicone sealant.  That product from Dow has been robust to dibenzyl ether as immersion medium over months of use.  

Nominal dimensions of chamber are given in sliceSpecimenChamber drawing v1.pdf. As long as assembled chamber fits within space provided, can hold sufficient immersion medium to immerse specimen, and presents a flat face through transmission path to detection lens and to fluorescence excitation, dimensions can be altered significantly to suit.
